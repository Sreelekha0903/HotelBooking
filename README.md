Hotel Dataset 

Problem Statement: 

The data is from one of the world’s largest online travel agencies (OTA) which powers search results for millions of travel shoppers every day.  

In this competitive market matching users to hotel inventory is very important since users easily jump from website to website. As such, having the best ranking of hotels (“sort”) for specific users with the best integration of price competitiveness gives an OTA the best chance of winning the sale. 

The dataset includes shopping and purchase data as well as information on price competitiveness. The data are organized around a set of “search result impressions”, or the ordered list of hotels that the user sees after they search for a hotel on the agency's website. The user response is provided as a click on a hotel or/and a purchase of a hotel room. 

To predict if the user chooses a hotel based on the users’ browsing history from search to bookings and payments.
